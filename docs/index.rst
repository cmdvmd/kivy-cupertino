Kivy Cupertino is a collection of iOS style widgets following
`Apple's Human Interface guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/>`_
to be used with the `Kivy <https://kivy.org/#home>`_ cross-platform graphical framework without sacrificing
ease of use or application performance.
