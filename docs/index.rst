Kivy Cupertino
==============

Kivy Cupertino is a collection of iOS style widgets following
`Apple's Human Interface <https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/>`_
guidelines. It is created to use for `Kivy's <https://kivy.org/#home>`_ cross platform framework.
The projectâ€™s goal is to approximate Apple's Human Interface spec as close as possible without sacrificing
ease of use or application performance.

.. warning::
   We are currently in **beta** status; not all widgets have been implemented and stability is not
   guaranteed. We don't recommend using Kivy Cupertino in production.
